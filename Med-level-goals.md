# Mid-Level Goals

- [ ] Build a runtime inference pipeline for the project datasets that auto-selects the best algorithm, sorts, and continues the workflow.
- [ ] Package the project as installable Python modules with simple user-facing APIs.
- [ ] Provide a one-command/one-call developer experience: import the library and run immediately with minimal setup.
- [ ] Validate performance on real datasets with reproducible experiments.
- [ ] Benchmark against strong baselines and report measurable speed/accuracy improvements.
- [ ] Expand and maintain a broad portfolio of supported sorting algorithms.
- [ ] Standardize reporting with clean tables, plots, and consistent output formats.
- [ ] Implement and evaluate novel ideas beyond the baseline approach.
