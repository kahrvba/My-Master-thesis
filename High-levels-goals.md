 
# High-Level Goals

- [ ] Predict the best sorting algorithm at runtime.
- [ ] Deliver this project as Python libraries with a fastest-setup import-and-run workflow.
- [ ] Achieve high-quality results on real-world data.
- [ ] Achieve strong benchmark performance against market-standard baselines.
- [ ] Support as many sorting algorithms as possible in the selection system.
- [ ] Produce clear results and high-quality, clean output.
- [ ] Introduce novel implementations as part of the thesis contribution.

## High-Impact Use Cases

- [ ] Validate adaptive selection on heterogeneous data pipelines.
- [ ] Validate runtime optimization in real data engineering and analytics workflows.
- [ ] Validate the system as a meta-system component for learned algorithm selection.
- [ ] Run a real-world case study on F1 telemetry/sensor data.
